# naughtylist
I've been working on a fun deck for Twitch chat that allows people to give a user a mystery present using !givepresent and for the given user to unwrap the mystery present using !open

Also inside the deck is a button for !naughtylist which when typed gives a 45/55 chance of getting coal or a present. The presents are a random list of presents and coal tells the user they're on the naughty list and has a 5% chance to time the user out for 1 minute unless they are the broadcaster, a mod or VIP then it will reroll the coal. 

I've included the deck JSON and a folder containing some images and a sound that you can use the deck button in there to make a scene on your OBS for a little fun alert (entirely optional)

I've put comments throughout the buttons within the deck, even an entire button that has explanations for the deck in the comments. So you can customise this to your needs or use as is
